# UFOs
In this project, a dynamic webpage was built by inserting javascript into an HTML page, 

Using JavaScript, an HTML table was built to organize UFO data that is stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were added to the table which enabled users to refine their search
The table was then placed into an HTML file for easy viewing . The webpage was customized using Bootstrap


Sighting information. Country, city, state, type of sighting and so on.

A date filter was created to filter the entire tabble by date. 

Continuing furthet withthe project, more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings will be provided by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter , table filters for the city, state, country, and shape will be included.
